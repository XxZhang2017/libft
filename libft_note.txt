strnew: '\0' terminated

void ft_striteri(char *s, void (*f)(unsigned int, char *));
char * ft_strmapi(char const *s, char (*f)(unsigned int, char));



strlcat: src may be not NULL-terminated
strncpy: if size less then src, dst may not append NULL

strlcat should be secure which means dst should be NULL terminated

strchr: search '\0'. 
    condition: reaching the end of the string, 


strstr: place i++ in while condition diff place i++ out of condition
        while (i++)
            ;
Vs      while (i)
            i++;
if i is index of the string, it affect the ele refered to in the arr

strrchr: search should start from the end, null terminal symbol.
    note: i = strlen(s) + 1

ft_atoi:
it should loop from begin to the end




?how to make putchar work with unicode and wild character?
?itoa, min-int crash, why?
?imporve, atoi overflow for int

note:
strnew, auto assign terminal, only pass the len of the
string
strsub, strcopy, strncopy, strcat, strlcat,
double think about it
